# NeatPythonBulletDodger
I made an ai that dodges bullets
It uses pyopencl , includes a backup feature(still buggy dont rely on it) , saves each generation's fittest model
right now nvida's cuda is not supported as i do not own one so im not planning to bring support for it and im going to stick with using pyopencl
im working on better tensorising the calculations
